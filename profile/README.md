Hi there :coffee: :wave:
========================
This is the :octocat: home of the [Snowfox](https://snowfox-project.org/) project.

Snowfox is a embedded software framework consisting of

* Hardware Abstraction Layer
* IO driver support for various sensors, actuators and communication controllers
* Industrial communication stacks

written in C++ subjected to rigorous unit and integration tests.

**This project is retired due to increasingly better vendor provided HALs and middleware.**
